- Tags help you find what you are looking for.

Similarly, if you want to find a person who has an area of expertise—but you do not know the name of the person—you can search for tags that describe that area of expertise. When you tag items and people, you are also helping others find what they are looking for.
- Tags save you time.
- Tags make use of the "wisdom of the crowd."
- When a large number of people apply tags to the same items and people, the group of people collectively expresses its knowledge about those items and people. Leveraging this collective knowledge helps you perform searches from a more informed perspective.', 'Tag writer', '1887-08-21');
